    "In Flask, templates are files that contain HTML markup with placeholders or variables that can be dynamically populated with data from your application.

    "\n",
    "Dynamic Content: Templates allow you to insert dynamic content into HTML pages by replacing placeholders with data from your application. This dynamic content can come from database queries, user input, or other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusable: Templates can be reused across multiple routes or views in your application. You can create consistent layouts and reuse them for different pages or sections of your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: Templates provide flexibility for customizing the appearance and layout of your web pages. You can easily update the HTML structure without modifying the underlying Python code.\n",

    "Security: Templates help prevent common web security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) by automatically escaping user input when rendering templates."
