    "    In Python, an exception is an unexpected or abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of a program is disrupted, and Python raises an exception object to handle the error. Exceptions can be caused by various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, division by zero, or any other situation that leads to a runtime error."

    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature of Error:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Exception: Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program when a valid Python statement or operation encounters an issue that prevents it from completing successfully. These issues are often related to data or external factors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Syntax Error: Syntax errors occur at compile time (before the program runs) and are caused by invalid Python code that doesn't follow the language's grammar rules. These errors are usually related to typos, incorrect indentation, missing colons, or other syntax-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing of Detection:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Exception: Exceptional errors are detected at runtime when the specific problematic code is executed. This means they can occur in code paths that are not executed unless certain conditions are met.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation phase before the program is executed. They prevent the program from running at all until the syntax issues are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Exception: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can write code to catch and gracefully handle exceptions, allowing the program to continue running despite encountering errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Syntax Error: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled during runtime because they prevent the program from being executed in the first place. They must be fixed in the source code."
